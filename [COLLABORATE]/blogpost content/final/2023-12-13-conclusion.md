# Conclusion
<p align="Justify">AI Wearable technology is indeed one of the greatest advancements that our generation has ever created, and its influence can greatly help in terms of productivity not just for individuals themselves, but also for workplaces and in other areas. There are also improvements that can be seen in different fields and using these technologies may improve oneâ€™s well-being as the above suggests. However, together with these advantages, there are also disadvantages that we need to consider, especially privacy risks and the tendency to be completely dependent on this technology which can result in long-term negative effects. Although some of these disadvantages are already given to other technologies, considering our dependency on them, we must put an effort into discovering more ways on how we can at least prevent those disadvantages and long-term effects from being tolerated, and must then innovate ways to lessen those negative effects. Furthermore, responsibility and discipline are a must in order to achieve those. Every developer should integrate this principle at all times in order to achieve a successful disruptive technology that follows the above measures and prevents potential risks as much as possible.
