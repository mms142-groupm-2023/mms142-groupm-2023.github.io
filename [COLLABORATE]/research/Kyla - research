I. AI Wearable Technology and Productivity in the Workplace
    While these accessories obviously sound promising and help with daily human activities, these wearable assistants can also improve employees’ performance and productivity (Belletier, et. al, 2021; Kuratomi, 2023; Khakurel, 2017). According to Belletier, et. al (2021), wearable technology assistants can eventually help a person’s cognitive limitations which can increase their ability to work simultaneously. For instance, a person’s “working memory” or the way we process and store information (p.105) can slow down their cognitive ability in situations where employees need to multitask which can lead to confusion and interfering thoughts. With the help of these wearable assistants, employees can get to perform tasks without worrying about cognitive constraints as well as the entry of information in the workplace.

II. Examples of wearable technology applied in the workplace: (Nahavandi, 2022)
    1. WearIT@work project (in Skoda Auto car Manufacturing)
        A wearable device consisting of a belt computer and a head-mounted display was created to replace traditional paper-based car quality assurance performed at the end of the assembly line. This was also created for the workers to be able to use it even without training.
        Problem – battery life, since workers will use it at normal working hours, thus, these wearable devices need to be useable for that amount of time.

    2. Carnegie Mellon University (CMU)’s “Navigator 2”
        This research and creation of wearable devices was used to lessen inspection time for mobile workers. 
        The creation of this wearable device has reduced the inspection time to 50%.
        Main challenges – interface design, cognitive model, contextual awareness, and adaptation to tasks being performed (p.14)

    3. Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech) order picking wearable device
        This device has helped workers in efficient order picking and could also help in preventing possible human errors.
        Challenge – wearability of head-mounted displays and optimization of decision-making for mobile workers through wearable computing. (p.14)

III. AI Wearable Technology in Other Areas
  Nahavandi (2022) listed different areas in which AI wearable technology can benefit from, these includes areas in:
    1. Sports – players can avoid potential injuries arising from heat stroke, for example. AI wearable devices can monitor a player’s vitals and maintain a balanced body temperature.
    2. Healthcare and health status monitoring – AI wearable technologies can monitor blood pressure, heart rate, etc.
    3. Fitness – wearable devices can track “fitness-related activities” (p.10) and motivate the user to be healthy, keeping in mind that measurements are not always accurate.
    4. Mental health – wearable devices are said to be useful in determining human physiology status based on collected data such as “heartbeat, blood pressure, body temperature, or ECG (p.13)”
    5. Helping with movement disorders – this can be used in assisting stroke patients in the movement of hips and knees, for instance.
    6. Autism – previous wearable technology devices were created to improve autistic children in emotion recognition as well as stereotypical motor movements (SMMs) (p.13) for decision-making.

IV. Problems with AI Wearable Technology
    The main problem involving wearable technology is that we are not sure about privacy and security risks that a particular accessory may possess, since these are worn in the body by users and collect data of various types such as heart rates, mental health, etc at any time (Fried, 2023; Belletier, et al, 2021; Kuratomi, 2023).
    Battery life – Some wearable technology needs a longer battery life since some are used primarily for workers in continued working shifts (Nahavandi, 2022).
    Long-term effect on the wearer’s body – long term health problems may be a result in wearing technology in your body for a longer time, but this needs further research to be able to list evidence on their negative effects (Nahavandi, 2022).
