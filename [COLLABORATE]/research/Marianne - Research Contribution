AI Wearables
  - AI wearables as a disruptive technology has this massive potential of changing and revolutionizing many industries. It’s been bringing new ideas to a wide variety of areas such as healthcare, work, communication, and even entertainment. It’s an innovative transformation blending artificial intelligence with the convenience of a wearable device.
  - AI wearable devices come in different types and forms that serve different functions and purposes. Smartwatches, clothing-based wearables, and smart glasses are some of the famous examples of this technology. Essentially, these devices gather data and information through smart algorithms giving their users precise and relevant information and details. These are among other many tasks that they can offer help for including health improvement, increasing productivity, and handling convenience matters as an artificial intelligence.

Statistics Related to AI Wearables
  - The market for AI wearables has been expanding rapidly. In a report by Allied Market Research (2022), the given technology is forecasted to achieve a total of $69.51 billion by 2026. The growth would be 26.5% from 2019 up to 2026. This number can be due to the anticipation of increasing demand for these wearable technologies. 
  - In 2019, it was predicted that a total of $42 billion worth of sales of wearables would be achieved by the end of the year. Moving forward to the next years, Statista forecasted a total of 158 million wearable units for 2022. This predicted surge is a reflection of the remarkable influence and trend of smart wearables in the market (Infopulse, 2019).

Influence of AI Wearables on Productivity 
  - In a study conducted by Khakurel et al. (2017), they found that wearables have the capability to improve productivity in workplaces. The study highlights that utilizing technology helps in the psychological and physiological well-being of employees. In particular, it helps facilitate smoother work, enhances operational effectiveness, reduces stress, and more.

What's Ahead for AI Wearables
  - Kuppahally (2016) highlights that wearable technology is not in any place decelerating at all. It is a technology that presents numerous innovative opportunities that different fields can utilize and leverage for efficiency and task management. But this anticipated surge should be a reminder to carefully harness the advantages while also prioritizing safeguarding against potential risks, especially concerning the data and privacy of users.
