A. Other AI-Powered Wearables

    There have been several cutting-edge AI-powered wearables in the market that have been making noises ever since the integration was introduced. Below are some of the noteworthy devices that are currently accessible in the market:

    - Whoop 4.0 -  an AI wearable fitness tracker that gives insights and biometric tracking with the help of biometric sensors
    - Apollo Neuro - an AI wearable developed mainly for stress and sleep management and operates with the help of vibration frequencies
    - Oura Smart Ring - an AI powered ring which uses different sensors and accelerometers that helps in providing body insights
    - Pavlok 3 - a wearable designed to operate with electrical impulses. It mainly uses the concept of aversive therapy.
    - Yopi (Your Online Personal Instructor) -  a wrist wearable device utilizing AI in measuring oxygen consumption. It aims to spot early indicators of health problems.
    - Rewind Pendant - an AI integrated pendant that functions with AI voice-to-text technology
    - Humane Ai Pin - a relatively new wearable that can give various forms of information with the help of AI


B. Additional Drawbacks 

Reliability and Accuracy 
    In a recent demo posted by Humane, AI Pin, a new AI powered-device, has been scrutinized due to giving two inaccurate responses. The device gave a wrong location to a certain question and miscalculated the protein content of almonds. Now, this poses a concern as to whether these AI wearable devices are reliable and accurate. 

Dependency 
    AI in general offers immediate solutions especially to our everyday activities. However, this can raise dependency which may lead to reliance on AI even on tasks we used to handle ourselves. According to Mahendra (2023), this can be detrimental to our critical thinking and can hugely affect other human skills.

Manipulation 
    Another concern regarding AI wearables is the possibility of manipulation. Ligot (2023) shared a possible harm with the AI Pin which is voice manipulation. The device in particular has a feature that operates with the help of the user’s voice. The voice can potentially be altered and might be susceptible to misuse.

Risk of Targeted Attacks 
    Unfortunately, wearables integrated with AI are also at risk of being targeted the same with other AI tools. Shipman (2023) mentioned a research wherein they stated that AI systems can possibly face problems with the so-called adversarial attacks. This attack can change and manipulate data going into the AI which may lead to big and serious problems.

Misuse of Other Wearable’s Features 
    Certain AI wearables have features that can be used to harm if it lands in the wrong hands. Features like cameras and recorders are designed for intended purposes. However, someone can use it with malicious intent. Ligot (2023) shared that the AI Pin projector could potentially be exploited and may cause serious harm.


C. Corporate Responsibility
    Vineet (2023) has listed Meta, Humane, and Rewind as the pioneers of the AI wearable technology. They hold a big responsibility in ensuring that the developments are ethically implemented and put user safety and privacy as their top priority as forerunners. It’s important that they understand and navigate the risks around this technology responsively. Ligot (2023) recommended proactive measures that might be applicable to these developers.
    - Emphasis on consent of the user
    - Strong and reliable encryption
    - Transparency
    - Regular software updates for AI-driven wearables
    - Cybersecurity audits
    - Enforcement of ethical guidelines
    - Implementation of data retention policies
