**Smart Glasses as Disruptive Technologies**
AI wearable assistants have emerged and seem to be considered disruptive technologies as they introduce new, innovative, and improved approaches in various aspects of daily life by integrating artificial intelligence with portable devices. These wearables such as the smart glasses, the Ai Pin, etc, employ machine learning to provide personalized experiences, adapting to user preferences and behaviors. Exemplifying the concept of ubiquitous computing, these AI wearable assistants reshape human-technology interaction, especially in ensuring productivity, by offering hands-free, efficient, and personalized solutions that transcend traditional computing methods. 

*Smart Glasses on Social Life*
Iqbal & Campbell (2022) assert that the adoption of innovative wearable technologies is gaining traction in society. They say Meta aims to revolutionize the way we interact digitally through a wearable on our faces. With its several technical features, Meta’s Ray-Ban stories will disrupt the need for smartphones for entertainment and socializing. It somehow reflects the concept of people in the movie Eve only in this case, digital content and information are superimposed on the world user sees around them, hence, it’s not entirely an AR or virtual environment.

Listed below are the major milestones in the journey of the smart glasses theme, as identified by GlobalData (2020).

*1990 – Former Boeing researcher Thomas P Caudell coined the term “augmented reality”.
*1994 – The Bluetooth wireless technology standard was developed by Jaap Haarsten of Ericsson.
*1999 – The first consumer Bluetooth device was launched.
*1999 – Battlefield Augmented Reality System (BARS), the first AR wearable device for soldiers, was released.
*2011 – Epson unveiled its Moverio BT-100 smart glasses.
*2013 – Google started selling a prototype of Google Glass.

*2022 – Apple and Facebook will launch their own AR smart glasses.
*2030 – Smart glasses will be a $2.3bn market, according to GlobalData forecasts.

*Smart Glasses on Productivity*
Calus (2023) presented 3 ways in which smart glasses disrupt field service: faster response times and more accurate field service delivery; reduced travel costs and enhanced skills with decentralized expertise: and cost-effective remote training for better first-time fix rates. He believes that the increasing number of demands requires an innovative approach that utilizes technology to facilitate the job at hand. Smart glasses solutions enable workers to connect with experts, artificial intelligence, IoT, and work instructions in real time while remaining hands-free. This boosts their productivity by enhancing resolution rates, customer satisfaction, and saving transportation costs.
Aside from field service, smart glasses can alleviate work pressures and improve productivity in many sectors (Steele, 2023). Some of them are:
*Healthcare – Smart glasses can be used to provide remote assistance, telemedicine, and assist with on-the-job training. It can also be used to document and detect issues in real-time, streamlining the process and reducing errors.
*Office and workplace – This wearable assistant enhances workflow processes. It can be used to provide 24/7 employee support, making it easier for workers to access the information they need.

*Smart Glasses' Ethical and Privacy Issues
It was emphasized by 	Iqbal & Campbell (2022) that these smart glasses came with many ethical and privacy concerns despite it having great benefits and pioneering future technological advancements. Hofmann et al (2016) identified a wide variety of smart glasses’ ethical issues. These relate to privacy, safety, justice, change in human agency, accountability, responsibility, social interaction, power, and ideology. Imagine the confidential information of someone being captured without their awareness and consent, it’s quite alarming. Developers must consider the potential risks and take appropriate measures to observe responsible usage. It includes implementing privacy controls, promoting responsible social interaction, among others.
