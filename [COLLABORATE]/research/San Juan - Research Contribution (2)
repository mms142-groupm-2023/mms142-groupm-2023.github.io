**Incorporation of Artificial Intelligence on Wearable Technologies**
It was as early as the 1960s when wearable technologies penetrated human-technology interaction. Thorp and Shannon pioneered it with a tiny four-button computer that could be carried through one’s hidden small pockets, or even strapped around the waist. The technology was designed to help gamblers cheat at roulette games. It was quite ingenious but we can’t deny the will of such innovative minds to constantly put forward new ideas as an improvement and to facilitate different aspects of our lives.

In line with this is the integration of artificial intelligence with these wearable technologies. NetAnalytiks (2023) explains that AI enables these wearable devices to learn, adapt, and make decisions autonomously, enhancing users’ lives in various ways. As the concept effectively improves user experience and the device’s functionality, it also employs the idea of ubiquitous computing (ubicomp) where utilizing the essential features of a computer is achieved anytime and anywhere—providing new levels of personalization, assistance, and knowledge.

Some notable AI-enabled wearables are the following:
*Health and Fitness Monitoring- with the incorporation of AI, these trackers are now able to monitor users’ different data for advanced health monitoring, sleep analysis, and personalized fitness recommendations.
*Smartwatches - from the common function of providing the time of day and the actual date, AI enables these devices to facilitate your common daily activities through Voice Assistants like Siri, Alexa, or Google Assistant. It can also be used for health tracking.
*Hearables/Smart Headphones - exemplified by Google Pixel Buds, a wearable technology augmented by AI can now assist you in continuously hearing spoken language translated into your ears together with the transcript displayed on your phone.
*Emotion Sensing - Wristbands were formerly deemed as fashion accessories but with the help of AI, they can now track and understand user’s emotional well-being. In the likes of Moodbeam, these technologies allow employers to empathize with their staff in the workplace.
*Smartglasses - The seemed-to-be futuristic features of glasses have now come to reality. From being an accessory, AI integration to glasses produced innovative solutions for monitoring, diagnosis, and personalized experience, all integral for various industries like healthcare, education, entertainment, and many more.

The incorporation of Artificial Intelligence into wearables highlights a revolutionary trend that facilitates people in different aspects of their lives through the enhanced capabilities and functionalities of such devices. AI-powered wearable technologies utilize advanced algorithms and machine learning to provide users with personalized and intelligent experiences. But remember, it’s integral to recognize the privacy and ethical implications of these devices while being impressed with their benefits.
