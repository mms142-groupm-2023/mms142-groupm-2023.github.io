**The Downside of AI-Powered Wearable Technologies**
While AI wearable technologies offer numerous benefits as they can be helpful in almost all aspects of our daily activities, they also come with certain drawbacks and challenges that need to be considered with the immediate efforts of the companies, as well as the considerations of all potential users. Here are some of the potential downsides associated with the use of AI in wearables:
*Privacy Concerns - These AI technologies collect sensitive personal data such as health information as part of their advanced monitoring and analysis. It can lead to significant privacy and ethical issues as the acquired information can be exploited by hackers or unauthorized entities. This requires serious implementation of privacy policies, not the one custom that commonly transpires as explained by Buckbee (2022) where it begins with “We respect your privacy” and ends with “We may share your information with third parties…”. Consequently, users must be literate and not be inconsiderate with the terms and conditions being presented to them. It must be a collective effort to address this challenge and utilize such AI devices in their most potential way.

*Accuracy and Reliability - While these devices have their built-in computing system that leverages AI algorithms and machine learning, Nimbus Search Partners (2022) asserts that continuous improvement is still necessary to enhance the accuracy and reliability of these programs, especially in health solutions. Reliance on faulty information could result in incorrect health assessments or recommendations, and perhaps compromise one essential goal of AI wearables—improving user experience.

*Cost and Accessibility - Cox (2023) believes that despite wearable technology being a game-changer in health and fitness, these devices, as products of big tech firms, can be expensive to some individuals. Aside from the price, the complexity of its system may require technical expertise, making it difficult to use. Perhaps, this limitation is caused by these technologies being new and freshly penetrating the market. After a few years, cost-friendly products may be manufactured and in that time people might already acquire knowledge of its technicalities.

It’s crucial to manage these downsides for it to successfully gain traction in society. This can be done through responsible design, transparent communication with the users, and the constant improvement of AI algorithms. Addressing privacy and ethical concerns, as well as the validity of information generated by these built-in systems, will be integral in gaining consumers’ trust. These are all important in maximizing the positive impact of AI wearables.
